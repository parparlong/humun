                Dave, the Streatham rapper who at just 19 has already<br> guested with US superstar Drake, was awarded best<br> contemporary song for Question Time, a seven-minute hip-<br>hoptrack that criticises Theresa May over lack of NHS<br>funding, military involvement in Syria, wage stagnation and<br>more. The track also castigates David Cameron over Brexit<br>(“You fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing line”)<br>and ponders whether Jeremy Corbyn can be an effective,<br>honest politician.<br> 
One particularly heartfelt verse attacks May over her<br>handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster.
